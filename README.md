This is a website that takes input from receipts and a person's email to automatically go through the surveys offered at the bottom of receipts and retrieve the reward code given at the end.
It then sends an email to the person's email with the code and all the person has to do is bring that code in with them the next time they go to the restaurant they got the receipt from.
